# Modeling data well in Clojure puts the focus on values (and particularly
# composite values), natural identifiers(auto generated), and sets and map.
#
# Synthetic identifiers are by definition artifacts of incidental complexity.
#
#
# If we have cycles in order, our data to stay value, we must add indirection
# layer that we can use to avoid cycles.
#
# We must fully embrace programing with values, to get the most out of
# Clojure.


# We should work with the real abstracitons cells and neighbors not indexes,
# rows or columns.
#
# Sometimes changing data structures is enough to simplify the problem. By
# proper choosing our data structures we can produce more generic code.
