* Summary

  Logic programming is a programming paradigm based on mathematical logic. In
  this paradigm the programmer specifies relationships among data values (this
  constitutes a logic program) and then poses queries to the execution
  environment in order to see whether certain relationships hold.

  Putting this in another way, a logic program, through explicit facts and
  rules, defines a base of knowledge from which implicit knowledge can be
  extracted.

  The Prolog execution environment doesnâ€™t so much "compute" an answer, it
  "deduces" an answer from the relation definitions at hand. Rather than being
  given an expression to evaluate, the Prolog environment is given an expression
  which it interprets as a question:

    For what parameter values does the expression evaluate to true?

  Prolog has not types. Identifiers starting with lower-case letters denote data
  values (almost like values in an enumerated type) while all other identifiers
  denote variables. Though the basic elements of Prolog are typeless, most
  implementations have been enhanced to include character and integer values and
  operations. Also, Prolog has mechanisms built in for describing tuples and
  lists.

* Prolog

  Prolog is referred to as a *declarative language*. A Prolog program consists of
  *facts* and *rules* which serve to define *relations*. Execution engine is
  based on *unification* and *resolution*, a mechanism for recursively
  extracting sets of data values implicit in the facts and rules of a program.
